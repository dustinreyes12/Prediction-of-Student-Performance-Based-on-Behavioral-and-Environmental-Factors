# Prediction of Student's Performance Based on Behavioral and Environmental Factors
The purpose of this project is to predict and classify a student's final grade based on behavioral and environmental factors. The goal is to predict whether the student will have a poor, fair or a good rating on his/her final grade. The project also aims to answer the question of what are the factors that can affect a student's performance. In doing the study, several machine learning algorithms were implemented and the algorithm which performed the best was chosen. The Gradient Boosting Classifier algorithm was chosen for this study with a test accuracy of 87 35 %.  With this, several insights can be deduced which are the ff • A student's previous grade has the most effect on his/her future performance • The record of absences and failures were contributors to a student's academic performance • Other factors which can affect a student were the mother's educational background, health conditions, age and weekend alcohol consumption
